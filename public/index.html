                      You do business with large companies every day, but it's a one-sided arrangement. You pay for a product or service, and you hope the company comes through on its end. When the company fails, you're expected to work through a system they devised to keep you from getting what you're owed. Who would waste hours on hold just to recover a few bucks? Who has the time to file a formal complaint with a company? You're too busy to take on the smallest fights with the biggest opponents, and companies count on that.

                  A company messes up and it's your job to fix it. You're expected to navigate their complaints process, fill out redundant forms, and wait on hold. <span class="pink">Gorilla does the boring work for you.</span>
                <br><br>
                  You give Gorilla your account information and tell it what's wrong. Gorilla handles the rest. Gorilla fills out forms with your personal and account information and calls customer service for you. When Gorilla reaches a real person, Gorilla gives your information to the customer service representative then explains the problem. 
                <br><br>
                  If Gorilla runs into a tricky question, it calls your phone, connecting you directly to the company's customer service representative. If you can't answer your phone when Gorilla calls, don't worry. Gorilla will simply start over again. Answer when you're ready to talk.

                    Verizon has a world-class customer service infrastructure with thousands of capable call center employees available to answer questions and solve service issues. Unfortunately, Verizon does not provide these resources for bill adjustments following service outages. If your service goes down, you're still charged for the whole billing period unless you file a formal notice. If you pay for minutes and your calls are dropped, you still lose those minutes.
                  </span></p>
                  <p><span>
                    Verizon's system for outage and lost minutes complaints is so difficult and frustrating to use that it's usually not worth your time to recover less than ten bucks. Gorilla fills in the forms and sits on hold for you. To complete the process, just answer your phone when Gorilla calls--or don't! Gorilla puts them on hold until you're ready to talk.

                    You signed up for Comcast. You accepted their offer of free upgraded channels, planning to cancel before the trial period ended. When you call Comcast to alter your plan, you are put on hold. When you reach a person, Comcast transfers you to another department and puts you on hold again. When you reach that department, you're asked to repeat your account information for a third time. Comcast employees are trained to waste your time when you call to lower your bill, hoping you'll put it off or simply give up.

                    Your Steam account was hacked and someone on another continent ran up $28 in charges to your account. You call Steam and they immediately freeze your account for review. Weeks pass and nothing happens. You're still paying for the month, but you don't get to play. You're charged for something you didn't buy, and Steam requires a separate process to recover your money.
                  </span></p>
                  <p><span>
                    Gorilla attacks Steam's customer service on two fronts: it works quickly to get your account through the review process, and it files for a review of the fraudulent charges. Once Gorilla has your account info, it does the rest. Simply answer your phone when Gorilla calls to complete the process.
